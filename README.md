# Credit Scoring Model

## Overview

This project implements a **Credit Scoring Model** using machine learning to predict whether a customer is creditworthy based on financial and personal data. Such models are commonly used by banks and financial institutions to assess loan risk.

## Objective

* Analyze customer financial data
* Build a classification model for credit risk prediction
* Evaluate model performance

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Dataset

* Customer financial dataset
* Features may include income, loan amount, credit history, age, etc.
* Target: Credit risk / approval status (Good / Bad)

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Run all cells in the notebook.

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* Confusion Matrix
